The concept of Playground in a Dream is based on my investigation of unconscious and conscious thoughts, emotions, and experiences living in a world of responsibilities.  
For so long, the only time I would be able to escape from reality is through writing stories and reading fictional stories. From writing and reading stories, I was able to unleash a part of my endless possibilities of a virtual world. 
My world is an escape from an unpredictable future of fears, doubts, and uncertainties which I created a world that is my escape from reality housed inside of a bowl of cereal. 
They are constituted by dreams, desires, and curiosities. I question, does our image of world-building reflect our desires to create our own worlds? What if there is a portal where you can watch the real world without temporary being a part of it? In this virtual space, in particular, I imagine a world of sweets like candy, donuts, and whatever you can imagine, you name it! It invokes positivity and playfulness filled with vibrant colors in which the viewers can explore the surrounding when entering the playground. As you are exploring you can also see a bright circular portal, as you enter that world you can see that two worlds are traversing and watching the world progressing as time passes by.
